# Lighten-Up

Lighten Up is an online quiz app in which users will be able to create quizzes and also be able to attempt the available quizzes. Users can create quizzes on any subject of interest, which need not necessarily come under academics, which makes the app more fun filled and universal. The app also gives an immediate analysis after attempting a quiz. We have developed the app such that it has a user-friendly interface. The main focus of developing this app is to explore various concepts of client-side and server-side scripting, with the help of HTML, Javascript, CSS, PHP and SQL.
